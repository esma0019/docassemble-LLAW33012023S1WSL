# Display legal issue as a bullet list.  If there
# is only one issue, then don't have a single
# bullet list.
# We construct the bullet list by creating a string 
# of HTML commands (markdown doesn't work in code I
# just found out this morning :-)
# We save our bullet list to display in a key called
# 'display legal issue' and we use that in our table.
code: |
  # Initialise the display with an empty string.  We'll use
  # a temp variable here because it's easier to read
  # The '<ul>' and '<li>' tags that you see are HTML commands
  # to make a bullet list.  
  WSLtemp_list = '<ul>'

  # Now add each item to the string as a markdown bullet list item
  for an_issue in WSL_Services[i]['hard issue']:
    if an_issue == 'Other':

    WSLtemp_list = '{}<li>{}</li>'.format(WSLtemp_list, an_issue)

  WSLtemp_list = '{}</ul>'.format(WSLtemp_list)
  # Now we've added each item, we can assign the temp variable
  # to the 'real' variable we want displayed
  WSL_Services[i]['display hard issue'] = WSLtemp_list

# I haven't put as many comments in here just in case all the
